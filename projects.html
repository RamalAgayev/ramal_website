            <h3>How does hardware work?</h3>
            <p>In this project, we worked on logic gates such as not, and, or, xor, nor and understand their meanings with a group of 4 people. It was first experience to me working in lab and it helped me a lot to understand its purposes.</p>
            <p>You can also watch a short video explanation of this project here:</p>

            <h3>Hour of AI</h3>
            <p>In this project, as a group we went to a school and taught them basic programming skills in Microsoft MakeCode. It was very interesting for children and also for us. It was also the first experience to me to teach lesson to a class. At the end, we gave certificates to children to make them happy.</p>
